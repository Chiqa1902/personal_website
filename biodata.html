<p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="Black"><b>Hi yea to all my viewers! This is where I start to officially introduce myself. &#128525; &#128525; &#128525</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, my full name is Nur Fatin Atiqah binti Supran. I was born on 19th February 2000, which makes me 21 years old this year. &#128517; Apperently I am old...&#128557; But not to worry my viewers! I am super young at heart.&#129409; Currently, I am living in Johor Bahru, Johor. I love it here. I do miss Kedah very much, though... My hobbies are reading, listening to music and swimming. To me, this things are my way to escape to my version of Neverland. I see things that I read vividly, music has a lot of hidden meaning and water reminds me of mermaids and mythical creatures... The sea makes me calm. Can you imagine the soft breeze, the splash of waves, the sunset and sunrise.... And when the sea is clear, you can see the gleaming shells and the fishes swimmimg lazily. To me, this is my heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My Father is currently not working due to his illness while my Mother is an English Language Teacher at a Secondary school in Kelantan. I have 6 siblings including me. I am the second eldest and are responsible of taking care of my household and my kid siblings. To be honest, it's is very tiresome when you have such a hectic household to manage but you know what? Where is the fun in having a normal peace and quiet. &#128514; &#128514; &#128514; &#128514;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Daya 2 as a kid and as a teen, I went to SMK Taman Daya 2. The miracle of two lives within my blood. want to know why? That's because I am the second eldest of six siblings, I went to 2 kindergardens-because my mother want me to have the religious and the wordly knowledge-I went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Daya 2 and SMK Taman Daya 2. Do you see the pattern here? If you do then you are a pretty bright person. &#128516;</p>
